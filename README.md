# Game Scripting Notes

This repository contains interactive Marimo note templates for our Game Scripting course.
These digital packets allow you to run code, view diagrams, and add your own custom notes that save automatically to your cloud environment.

## Quick Start Guide

1. **Create Your Personal Workspace**

    - Click on the green **"Code"** button at the top of the repository.
    - Select the **"Codespaces"** tab
    - Click **"Create codespace on main"**. *This builds a private virtual machine just for you with Python and Marimo pre-installed.*

2. **Launch Your Notes**

    - Once the editor loads in your browser, look at the Terminal at the bottom and type:
        ```bash
        marimo edit "filename.py" --no-token
        ```
        *Replace `<filename>` with the name of the note file you want to open (e.g., `"Week 1 Notes.py"`).*
    - The `--no-token` flag ensures you aren't delayed by a password screen caused by the Codespace's port forwarding.

## Saving Your Work

- All your changes are saved automatically in your personal Codespace.
- To back up your work, you can download the files or push them to your own GitHub repository.
